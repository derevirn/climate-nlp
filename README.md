# Topic Modeling on Climate Change News Articles
## Project Scope
The purpose of this project is to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to articles about climate change, published in various news websites. More specifically, we are going to use topic modeling, hence extracting insights about the aforementioned websites and the ways that climate change is presented in global media. Ultimately, our goal is to evaluate whether news publications present climate related topics with scientific rigor, and identify possible narratives of misinformation.

## Tools
In this project, we are going to utilize the Python data science stack, i.e. Jupyter notebooks, pandas, matplotlib and other associated libraries. Furthermore, the [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) library will be used for topic modeling.

## Data
Our dataset is comprised of news articles about climate change, that were published in various websites during 2022. We collected those articles by using the [NewsCatcher API](https://newscatcherapi.com/) service.
