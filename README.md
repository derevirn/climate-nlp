# Topic Modeling on Climate Change News Articles
## Project Scope
The purpose of this project is to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to articles about climate change, published in various news websites. More specifically, we are going to use topic modeling, hence extracting insights about the aforementioned websites and the ways that climate change is presented in global media. Ultimately, our goal is to evaluate whether news publications present climate related topics with scientific rigor, and identify possible narratives of misinformation.
